There is no Test or Exam this Term. However, there are marks for successfully publishing your Android App to Google Play Store, 20% of the final year mark in total.

The Android App will use your Domain App as a backend. To make this happen, you will need to deploy your application to the cloud at  http://run.pivotal.io/ or openshift.com.
